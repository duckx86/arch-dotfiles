# basic keymaps
- Hyprland
Every keymap starts with the super key (special key on your keyboard, probably the Windows key), I didn't write them here.
```
F | Maximize current window
<Shift>-F | Fullscreen current active window
Q | Open terminal
C | Close current active window
X | View clipboard history
Z | Takes a screenshot of the entire screen
<Shift>-Z | Screenshot + slurp (cropped screenshot)
R | Opens rofi
E | File manager (thunar)
V | Toggle floating
```
